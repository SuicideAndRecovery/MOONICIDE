An idea for a player versus environment (PvE) game on the Sanctioned Suicide forum.

## Threads as battles
Reading a thread starts a battle. The player can read the thread while the battle takes place. Battles award currency, randomly generated items or characters.

## Battle system
Battles are a turn-based, rock-paper-scissors game. Players take turns attacking and defending.

Each player randomly draws three cards from their decks at a time. Cards are either Rock, Paper or Scissors. Cards have additional effects when played (card text). Each player chooses one card and discards the rest.
